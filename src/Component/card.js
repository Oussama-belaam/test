                    We are a group of friends that all had a passion for nature and the outdoors. 
                    Turns out, having a home filled with plants was something we continued to have in common. 
                    We found it difficult to find a place online to purchase houseplants that was easy to navigate 
                    and wasnâ€™t just geared to wholesale.So, in 2020, we decided to launch to be the ultimate destination 
                    for everything houseplants.Please enjoy exploring Clores.
